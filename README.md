## A Google Chrome Extension

I like watching the podcast, but one thing I preferred about YouTube's platform is the
theater mode that they have. The video is well sized and fits the window, even when I
set it to a third or a fourth of my screen. Viewing it this way lets me work on something
in the forground with the majority of my viewing real-estate going to my primary task
and allowing my to listen and look over at moments of interest. Spotify doesn't do the
same thing with video, and only crams a small (yet fully HD) version of the video into
the corner of their UI. This script overrides some of their CSS allowing me to view it
in arbitrarily larger sizes that look similar to YouTube's theater mode.

## Building it yourself

You only need a few developer tools and some software:
- Make
  - Orchestrates the build
- Zip
  - For the actual binary that you load in chrome or that I can upload to Google
- Affinity Designer
  - To export the icon I made into a PNG file
- ImageMagick
  - To resize the base icon for Chrome
